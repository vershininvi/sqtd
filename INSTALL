I. Getting sources

You can get a local copy of the sqtd repository with this command:
   git clone https://code.google.com/p/sqtd/ sqtd

II. Installation the sqtd from source

You need cmake (http://www.cmake.org/)  to configure and install sqtd.
Follow this simple steps: 
 1.  Go to source directory (cd sqtd)
 2.  Create build directory (mkdir  biuld)
 3.  Go to build directory  (cd build) 
 4.  Create build cache from source directory (cmake ../)        
 5.  Compile program (make)
 6.  Install program   (make install)

You can change some build options from source directory (cmake -i build or using cmake-gui).

See build/install_manifest.txt for installed files. 

You can run  make DESTDIR=/path/to/destination"   to install sqtd in destination directory.   

See cmake manuals for other options. 


To uninstall program
1.   Go to build directory 
2    Uninstall program (make uninstall)
3.   Check /usr/sharedoc/sqtd-* directory and remove it if unnecessary  (for default configuration)
4.   Remove /var/lib/sqtd directory if unnecessary.
5.   Remove /var/lib/sqtd directory if unnecessary.


III. Installation for gentoo (www.gentoo.org)

You can use  sqtd-*.ebuild file from source directory 

IV.  Package for other *NIX 

   Sorry, I can not create and support binary package for other *nix. 
   I believe, you can create it from source.
